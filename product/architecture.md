## Component Details

### API Gateway Layer
- **FastAPI Framework**: Provides automatic OpenAPI documentation and high-performance async capabilities
- **Request Validation**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity
- **Middleware Stack**: Logging, rate limiting, CORS, and error handling
- **Authentication**: Optional JWT or API key authentication

### Download Engine
- **HTTP Client**: httpx for async HTTP operations with connection pooling
- **Content Negotiation**: Support for multiple response formats via Accept headers
- **Content Processing**: Intelligent extraction for HTML, markdown conversion, PDF handling
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable retry attempts
- **Content Streaming**: Efficient handling of large files without memory exhaustion
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascade failures from problematic URLs

### Caching Layer
- **Redis Integration**: High-performance in-memory caching
- **TTL Management**: Configurable time-to-live based on content type
- **Cache Strategies**: Write-through and write-behind caching patterns
- **Eviction Policies**: LRU eviction for memory management

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: 12-factor app configuration principles
- **Runtime Updates**: Hot-reload capabilities for non-critical settings
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout and A/B testing support

## Data Flow

### Single URL Download Flow
1. Client sends GET request with URL-encoded target URL and optional Accept header
2. API Gateway validates request and checks rate limits
3. Service checks Redis cache for existing content
4. If cache miss, initiates HTTP download with timeout controls
5. Content is processed based on Accept header (text/plain, text/html, text/markdown, application/pdf, application/json)
6. Processed content is streamed back to client with appropriate headers
7. Successful downloads are cached in Redis (if enabled)

### Batch Download Flow
1. Client sends POST request with JSON payload of URLs
2. Request validation ensures payload size and URL count limits
3. URLs are distributed across async worker pool
4. Each URL follows individual download flow concurrently
5. Results are aggregated and returned as structured JSON
6. Partial failures are handled gracefully with detailed error reporting

## Security Architecture

### Input Validation
- URL format validation and normalization
- Payload size limits and structure validation
- SQL injection and XSS prevention
- Parameter sanitization

### SSRF Protection
- Domain blacklist/whitelist enforcement
- Private IP range blocking (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)
- Localhost and internal service protection
- DNS resolution monitoring

### Rate Limiting
- Per-IP rate limiting with sliding window
- API key-based quotas
- Distributed rate limiting via Redis
- DDoS protection and traffic shaping

## Performance Considerations

### Async Architecture
- Non-blocking I/O for all HTTP operations
- Event loop optimization for high concurrency
- Connection pooling for external requests
- Efficient memory usage patterns

### Caching Strategy
- Content-based caching with smart TTL
- Cache warming for popular URLs
- Memory usage monitoring and limits
- Cache invalidation patterns

### Resource Management
- Worker pool sizing based on system resources
- Memory-mapped file handling for large content
- Garbage collection optimization
- Connection timeout management

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Request/response metrics (latency, throughput, errors)
- System metrics (CPU, memory, network)
- Business metrics (cache hit rates, download success rates)
- Custom application metrics

### Logging Strategy
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Request/response logging with PII filtering
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance profiling data

### Health Checks
- Liveness probes for container orchestration
- Readiness checks for load balancer integration
- Dependency health monitoring (Redis, external services)
- Deep health checks for comprehensive system status

## Deployment Architecture

### Container Strategy
- Docker containerization for consistency
- Multi-stage builds for optimized image size
- Security scanning and vulnerability management
- Resource limits and requests configuration

### Orchestration
- Kubernetes deployment with horizontal pod autoscaling
- Service mesh integration for advanced traffic management
- Config maps and secrets management
- Rolling updates and blue-green deployments

### Infrastructure
- Cloud-native deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory/custom metrics
- Load balancing with health check integration
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless service design for easy horizontal scaling
- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Database connection pooling and management
- Session affinity considerations

### Vertical Scaling
- Memory optimization for large file handling
- CPU optimization for concurrent processing
- I/O optimization for network operations
- Storage optimization for caching

### Performance Optimization
- Connection reuse and keep-alive optimization
- Compression support (gzip, brotli)
- Content delivery network integration
- Geographic distribution strategies
